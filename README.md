# NetWatch üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Educational Notice

**EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

NetWatch is a network monitoring and traffic analysis tool with an interactive Streamlit dashboard, created for educational purposes to help students and security researchers understand network monitoring concepts, traffic analysis, and basic intrusion detection principles.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is designed and intended **STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES**. It should only be used in controlled environments where you have explicit permission to monitor the network traffic. Using this tool to monitor networks or devices without authorization may be illegal and unethical.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Linux/Unix-based system
- Root/sudo privileges
- Required packages:
  - tcpdump
  - arp-scan
  - whiptail
  - mailutils (for email alerts)
  - curl (for Slack integration)
  - tshark (for PCAP analysis)
  - jq (for JSON processing)
  - modern web browser (for dashboard)

### Installation

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tcpdump arp-scan whiptail mailutils curl tshark jq

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install tcpdump arp-scan whiptail mailutils curl wireshark jq
```

## üöÄ Local Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher
2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Locally

1. Start the Streamlit dashboard:

   ```bash
   sudo streamlit run netwatch.py
   ```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Dashboard

1. **Network Scanning**:
   - Click 'Scan Network' to discover devices
   - View device IP and MAC addresses

2. **Traffic Capture**:
   - Enter target IP address
   - Set capture duration
   - Start capture and monitor progress

3. **PCAP Analysis**:
   - Select captured PCAP file
   - View interactive visualizations
   - Analyze protocol distribution
   - Monitor packet sizes over time

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Building the Container

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t netwatch .
```

```bash
# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name netwatch \
  --network host \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  netwatch
```

## üçì Raspberry Pi Deployment

### Setting up Raspberry Pi

1. Install Docker on Raspberry Pi:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

2. Clone and deploy NetWatch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netwatch.git
   cd netwatch
   docker build -t netwatch .
   docker run -d \
     --name netwatch \
     --network host \
     --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
     --cap-add=NET_RAW \
     netwatch
   ```

3. Access the dashboard:
   - From Raspberry Pi: `http://localhost:8501`
   - From other devices: `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:8501`

### Remote Access Setup

1. Configure port forwarding on your router:

   - Forward port 8501 to your Raspberry Pi
   - Use a strong password for Streamlit

2. For secure remote access:

   - Set up a VPN server on Raspberry Pi
   - Access through VPN connection
   - Or use SSH tunnel:

     ```bash
     ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 pi@<raspberry-pi-ip>
     ```
