ChatGPT Prompt for Fixing NetWatch Issues
=======================================

As a Senior Python Developer, I need assistance in resolving several critical issues in our NetWatch network monitoring application. The application is built with Streamlit and consists of three main components: Network Scanning, Traffic Capture, and PCAP Analysis.

Current Issues:

1. Device Tracking System:
   - The application fails to properly handle device tracking due to inconsistent data types
   - MAC addresses are sometimes stored as strings and sometimes as dictionaries
   - Need a unified approach to device data structure and storage

2. Permission and Access Control:
   - Network capture functionality requires elevated privileges
   - Need a proper privilege escalation mechanism or user guidance

3. Data Flow and State Management:
   - Inconsistent state management between pages
   - PCAP file handling and analysis pipeline needs improvement
   - Web traffic analysis fails due to missing data validation

Technical Requirements:

1. Data Structure Standardization:
   - Define a consistent device data model
   - Implement proper type checking and conversion
   - Add data validation layers

2. Error Handling:
   - Add comprehensive error handling for device operations
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for missing data
   - Add user-friendly error messages

3. State Management:
   - Implement proper Streamlit session state management
   - Add data persistence between page reloads
   - Create a robust data pipeline for PCAP analysis

4. Security:
   - Add proper privilege checking
   - Implement secure file handling
   - Add input validation

Please provide a detailed solution addressing:

1. Code structure improvements
2. Data model standardization
3. Error handling implementation
4. State management best practices
5. Security considerations

The solution should maintain the existing functionality while improving reliability and user experience.

Technical Context:
- Framework: Streamlit
- Language: Python 3.8+
- Key Libraries: pandas, scapy, plotly
- Platform: Cross-platform (primary focus on macOS)

2025-04-15 12:11:41 - Error: IndentationError in scanner.py
    Context: Duplicate code in get_new_devices method
    Impact: Application failed to start
    Resolution: Fixed indentation and removed duplicate code

2025-04-15 12:11:45 - Warning: Scapy IPv4 address warnings
    Context: Network interface scanning
    Impact: Non-critical, some interfaces may not be scanned
    Resolution: Expected behavior for inactive interfaces

2025-04-15 12:11:45 - Warning: Scapy CryptographyDeprecationWarning
    Context: IPSec module initialization
    Impact: Non-critical, future compatibility issue
    Resolution: Will need to update Scapy or dependencies in future

2025-04-15 12:17:15 - Error: Device data model inconsistency
    Context: Trying to access device attributes as dictionary keys
    Impact: Network scan page fails to display untracked devices
    Resolution: Updated code to use NetworkDevice object attributes instead of dictionary access

2025-04-15 12:19:45 - Fix: Data model conversion
    Context: Converting device history data to NetworkDevice objects
    Impact: Ensures consistent device data model across application
    Resolution: Added proper NetworkDevice object creation in get_new_devices method

2025-04-15 12:22:30 - Fix: Device history loading
    Context: Incorrect device history data format when loading from JSON
    Impact: Application fails to start with 'mac' key error
    Resolution: Properly initialize tracked devices before loading device history and fix data format conversion

2025-04-15 12:26:30 - Fix: Device tracking system
    Context: Unhashable type error when using list for tracked devices
    Impact: Cannot track or untrack devices
    Resolution: Changed tracked_devices to use a set for MAC addresses and properly handle JSON serialization

2025-04-15 12:52:00 - Fix: Mixed device data format
    Context: Tracked devices file contains mix of strings and objects
    Impact: Error when trying to call lower() on dictionary objects
    Resolution: Added proper handling for both string MAC addresses and device objects

2025-04-15 13:48:00 - Fix: Device data handling
    Context: Trying to use .get() on NetworkDevice objects
    Impact: Error when trying to access device data
    Resolution: Updated get_new_devices to use NetworkDevice objects directly from device_history

2025-04-15 17:17:00 - Fix: Traffic capture UI
    Context: Trying to access device data as dictionary instead of NetworkDevice object
    Impact: Error when trying to access device attributes in traffic capture UI
    Resolution: Updated all device data access to use NetworkDevice object attributes

2025-04-15 18:17:00 - Fix: Device data handling in traffic capture
    Context: Inconsistent device data handling in traffic capture section
    Impact: No devices available in traffic capture UI
    Resolution: Updated device data handling to consistently use NetworkDevice objects
